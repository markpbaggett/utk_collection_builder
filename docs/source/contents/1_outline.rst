Introduction to Collection Builder
==================================

What is CollectionBuilder?
--------------------------

`CollectionBuilder <https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>`_ is an n open source framework for creating digital collection
and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. This allows you to create
a collection and host it on lightweight infrastructure, without the need for a database or server-side scripting language.

Why use CollectionBuilder?
--------------------------

The high cost and IT requirements of digital collection platforms are often a barrier to creating new collections for
sharing or teaching humanities research. CollectionBuilder is optimized for non-developers and simple hosting solutions,
allowing researchers and educators to take greater ownership over their digital projects and lowering barriers to
website customization.

Using well-structured metadata and a directory of digital files, CollectionBuilder employs a Jekyll static web generator
to create a website for visualizing, browsing, and accessing the collection.

The Original Lib-Static "Manifesto", 2018
-----------------------------------------

CollectionBuilder is very much built in the spirit of the `Lib-Static "Manifesto." <https://lib-static.github.io/community/manifesto/>`_

Lib-Static is a minimal computing-based approach to creating data-driven tools leveraging static-web technologies and
librarians’ specialized skills in metadata and classification to create engaging web publications via three components:

1. a spreadsheet with well-formed metadata
2. a directory of assets
3. and a configuration file.

Static-web technologies are a set of tools that allow for the creation of web pages without the need for a database. Examples
of static web technologies include Jekyll, Hugo, and Pelican as well as JavaScript JAM stack tools like Gatsby and Next.js.

The manifesto describes a methodology for creating web publications and applications that are:

1. Open: powered by open tools and open data.
2. Simple(ish): basic infrastructure requirements and less IT.
3. Librar* Optimized: Full control over the content and data (no 3rd parties) and leverage the skills of libraries (not coders)
4. User-focused: Engaging designs the encourage user interaction, visualization for discovery, and accessibility for all. Reusable and reshareable metadata.

Origins of the Manifesto
------------------------

In response to challenges and frustrations with library systems, LibStatic originators started to see that there were
ways to build these systems and tools that did not lock libraries into proprietary contracts nor lock themselves out of
the code and data driving the site’s presentation. These experiences led to a philosophy of development that leverages
the expertise of librarians and cultural heritage workers and the unique values of their institutions at the forefront
of project design decisions. This methodology differs greatly from the predominant model for platform and tool building
for academic libraries as it does not require complex infrastructure nor specialized developers to build, implement,
and maintain the systems put into use. The shift towards a focus on clean data and simple systems enables a more agile
and responsive approach, allowing the iterative development of features, gradual acquisition of developer skills, and
flexible migration between hosts without the need for deep investment.
